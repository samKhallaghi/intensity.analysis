#' @title Intensity Analysis on categorical maps of the same geographical extent and resolution.
#' @description This package provides the methodology to analyz maps of categorical variables from several points in time for a single site condidering cross-tabulation matrices, where each matrix summerizes the change in each time interval. There are three levels of analysis namely: interval, category and transition. Each level tests for tests for size and stationarity of patterns across time intervals.
